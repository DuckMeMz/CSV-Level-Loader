This CSV parsing system was made with an in-house engine called hornet. The assignment was to create a systemt that can dynamically create a level based off of the provided CSV file. I focused heavily on scalable and maintainable code as if it would be needed to be used in the future by other developers. 
A requirement of the assignment was that lots of comments, justification and explaination of your methods behind the programming was to be written out in code comments that is why there are so many comments.
