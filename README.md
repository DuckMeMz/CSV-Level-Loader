## Games Programming 1 - Assignment - 100/100

- This code was for my games programming 1 assignment. For which I got 100/100. <br>
- The task was to create a CSV parser than intakes a given configuration file and loads a level dynamically from it. <br>
- This system is used along side an in-house framework called hornet. <br>
- I focused heavily on scalable and maintainable code as if it would be needed to be used in the future by other developers. <br>
- One of the requirements was to comment, explain and jusitfy all of your methods and rationale behind development decisions. This is the reason for the amount of comments.<br>
