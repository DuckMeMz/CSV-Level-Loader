# CSV Level Loader ðŸ“‘

This CSV Level Loader loads a demo game from a single CSV file, allowing designers to add or modify levels without touching any code. <br>

I achieved a mark of **100/100**, demonstrating my ability to create safe, structured code while explaining and supporting my design decisions. <br>
## Highlights
- **Code-free level design** allows designers to add or modify levels without changing code
- **Thoroughly documented** clearly explaining and supporting design decisions
- **Robust error handling** allowing for easier debugging and maintenance

*Note: The level of commenting and justification included was required by the assignment and is exccessive for typical code.*
